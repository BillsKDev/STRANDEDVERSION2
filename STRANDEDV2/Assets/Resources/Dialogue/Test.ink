Thank god someone made it...
* What happen? Who are you?
There was a crash, you don't remember? I'm part of the organization that sent you there to check out the signals we were recieving there.
** What should I do?
For now, you need to get situated, we won't be able to reach you until a couple days so try to survive there for as long as possible until we arrive.
*** But I have no idea what is around me!
 "The signal you are trying to reach is invalid..."
 **** Here goes nothing...
