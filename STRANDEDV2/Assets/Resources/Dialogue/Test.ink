Hello, is anyone reading this? If anyone survived please reply immediately!
* What happen? Who are you?
There was a crash, you don't remember? I'm part of the organization that sent you there to check out the signals we were recieving there.
** I don't understand much, but what should I be doing?
For now, you need to get situated, we won't be able to reach you until a couple days so try to survive there for as long as possible until we arrive.
*** I have no idea how I should start out
 Try to find some resources around the area that could help you... Maybe you can use them to make some stuff to help you out
